const info = "Newshak is a system designed for management and delivery of assignments between two different types of users. For one of the types of users, the Student, Newshak aims to provide a simple and efficient way of delivering assignments and getting the needed feedback for the said assignments. While using Newshak as a Student, anyone with given permission, should be able to deliver assignments, and get the feedback for that assignment, such as grading and errors. For the other type, the Teacher, Newshak intends to provide a way to setup assignment deliveries, as well as managing the grading and sorting of those same assignments. While using Newshak as a Teacher, anyone should be able to create assignment deliveries, where Students can send in assignments, as well as manage and grade (automatically or manually) those same assignments."
